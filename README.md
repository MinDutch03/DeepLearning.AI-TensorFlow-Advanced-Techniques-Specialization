## About This Specialization
  In this Specialization, you will expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types. You will learn how to optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. You will also explore generative deep learning including the ways AIs can create new content from Style Transfer to Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs.
